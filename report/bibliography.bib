abstract = {Flow past a circular cylinder with a slit results in local perturbation, which affects the flow pattern, vortex shedding and the aerodynamic forces. This study uses spectral element method to simulate flow past a cylinder with a normal slit or an inclined slit at Reynolds numbers of Re=100 to 500. For a cylinder with a normal slit, the drag and amplitude of the oscillating lift both increase as the width of the slit increases. There are two modes for a cylinder with an inclined slit: an injection mode and a blowing/suction mode. The drag also increases as the angle of inclination of the slit increases and is greater than that for a cylinder that has no slit for flow in the blowing/suction mode, except at low Reynolds numbers, such as Re=100. Increasing the width of slit or the angle of inclination of the slit increases the frequency of vortex shedding. However, a wider slit or larger angle of inclination also results in additional drag. There is a similarity between the external surface and the slit in that the aerodynamic forces due to pressure or shear stress vary with the angle of inclination of the slit.}

    abstract = { The purpose of this study is to provide some insights into the phase mechanism of a cylindrical vortex–induced vibration. A transient coupled fluid–structure interaction numerical model is adopted to simulate a cylindrical vortex–induced vibration. The vortex shedding around the cylinder is investigated numerically by a two-dimensional large eddy simulation approach which can catch more details of the flow field and more accuracy on computing hydrodynamic forces. The vortex shedding modes and response and hydrodynamic forces of a cylindrical vortex–induced vibration are acquired with varied frequency ratios. According to differences in the vortex shedding location, the vortex wake can be characterized by two kinds of mode, the “first mode” and the “second mode.” The mechanisms behind the phases of the first mode and the second mode vortex wakes are investigated, and it is found that the flow speed induced by a cylindrical transverse vibration and the position of a vortex release are the root causes of the phase difference between the lift coefficient and transverse displacement. The speeds caused by a cylinder vibration and a cylinder-shed vortex are the reasons that the lift amplitude of an oscillatory cylinder is different from that of a fixed cylinder. }
