In conclusion, we implemented and tested a solver for the incompressible and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, supporting a variety of physical problems. We then applied the solver to the two and three dimensional flow past a cylinder benchmark, computing the velocity, pressure and lift and drag coefficients for a variety of configurations and commenting on the results. Finally, we implemented multiple preconditioners for the problem and analyzed the performance, scalability and optimality of the best performing one.
