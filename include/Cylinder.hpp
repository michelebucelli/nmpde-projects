// In this file we define the classes for the flow past a cylinder test cases.
// To do this, we create a template class for the cylinder test case, which
// contains the common features of the test cases. This class is a template on
// the dimension, because it needs to be defined as constexpr for technical
// reasons. Then, we create two derived classes, one for the 2D case and one
// for the 3D case. These classes contain the specific features of the test
// cases, such as the inlet velocity and the initial conditions.

// This is a template class for the flow past a cylinder test case. It is
// templated on the dimension, which can be either 2 or 3. The reason for this
// is that we need the dimension to be known at compile time. The class is
// derived from the NavierStokes class, which is a template class itself, for
// the same reason. A similar approach is used in most of our other classes.
